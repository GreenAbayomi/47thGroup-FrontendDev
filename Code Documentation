#Overview of Project

The project is the landing page of the Sunnyside agency and 
the project is expected to test the layout and responsive skills of the members of the group.
This project focuses mostly on HTML & CSS. There's a tiny bit of JS included for the mobile navigation toggle. 
The users should be able to:
(a) View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
(b) See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

#Methodology/Process
The technologies used in the project are HTML5, tailwindcss utilities and vanilla JS.
The HTML is used for the markup, tailwindcss was used for styling the page while a little bit of JS was used for the Hamburger click event
in the navbar of the project.

#Lessons Learnt

The project gave us the opportunity to put into practice all that was taught during the past 4 weeks of the internship.
Tailwindcss moved from being just the framework we hear our instructors speak highly of to that framework 
that actually performed magic for us in the project.
